//I. Check the scope of let first
 {

     console.log(numbers);
 }

 //A3 - writing the numbers variable after the block
 //The result in the console is TODO:
 //Why did we get such result? TODO:
 console.log(numbers);



//II. Now, check the scope of const
{
    //A1 - writing the PI variable before declaration
    //The result in the console is TODO:
    //Why did we get such result? TODO:
    console.log(Pi);

    const PI = 3.14;
    //A2 - writing the PI variable after declaration
    //The result in the console is TODO:
    //Why did we get such result? TODO:
    console.log(PI);
}

//A3 - writing the PI variable after the block
//The result in the console is TODO:
//Why did we get such result? TODO:
console.log(PI);
