# let i const &ndash; exercises

### Setup

> Create a fully working environment that will allow you to write JavaScript code in version 6.
>
> Remember to:
> - Run ```npm init``` command
> - Install appropriate modules
> - Set Webpack - the output file should be `js/out.js`

## Exercise done with the lecturer

### Variable scope (~ 5min)

In ```app.js``` create two variables with ```const``` and ```let```. Check their scope in:
* a loop
* a function
* a code block - { }


## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1 (~ 5min - 10min)

Take a look at ```exercise01.js```. There is a code fragment where variables created with ```let``` and ```const``` are visible and available to be used in the code. The task is to execute the code, test in the console for results and describe your observations in comments in places marked TODO.

### Exercise 2 (~ 2min - 5min)

Take a look at ```exercise02.js```. Your task is to analyze the code and describe your observations in a comment.


### Exercise 3 (~ 5min - 7min)

In ```app.js``` create a ```for``` loop that will write variable ```i``` ten times. Initiate the ```i``` variable as a ```var``` ranging 0 - 10.
Try to display the ```i``` variable outside the loop. What will be displayed?

Now, create another ```for``` loop below only this time with a different variable, e.g. ```j```. Initiate it as a ```let```.
Try to display the ```j``` variable outside the loop. What will be displayed?

### Exercise 4 (~ 5min - 7min)

Try to modify variables created in the ```exercise04.js``` file. Describe your observations in comments.

### Exercise 5 (~ 5min - 10min)

In ```app.js``` create an IIFE (anonymous) function that will write "hello world" in the console.

### Exercise 6 (~ 2min - 5min)

In ```app.js``` create an IIFE (anonymous) function that will write in the console the parameter passed to it, e.g. ```name```.
