>
> Remember to:
> - Run ```npm init``` command
> - Install appropriate modules
> - Set Webpack - the output file should be `js/out.js`


## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1 (~ 2min - 5min)

In the ```js``` directory you will find 3 files:
* ```polygon.js``` - containing a class that describes a geometric figure (polygon)
* ```square.js``` - containing a class that inherits from polygon
* ```app.js``` - where you will create an object based on the Square class.

Your task is to merge the files so that the Square sees the Polygon, and app.js sees the Square class.
The output file ```out.js``` should not cause any problems in the console.
